    <b>Welcome to lucabruni.dev!</b>
    <br>
    This barebones HTML/CSS page inspired by the web of the 90s and early 2000s contains a bit about my personal life,
    professional experiences, and passion projects.
    The page is intended to be paired with a modern counterpart under the same domain (WIP).
    Below is a summary of each page on the navigation bar:
    <p></p>

    <ul class="splash-list">
      <li>
        <b>About:</b> A bit about my personal life/interests, with some lore about
        my entry into the computer science/software engineering industry, and what I've been doing since.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Résumé:</b> Will contain a PDF copy of my most up-to-date résumé/CV, any
        relevant certifications, achievements, awards, and other professional accolades.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Projects:</b> Code projects from the past or ongoing (if progress is significant). Will contain
        descriptions, screenshots, and links to source code or project hub.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Games:</b> 10/10 games. 'Nuff said.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>3D Prints:</b> I recently obtained a Bambu Labs P1S + AMS. 
        This will showcase prints, including photos, filament and hardware information, and calibration/slicing parameters.
        Where applicable I will also include relevant files for each model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Gallery:</b> Cool photos and videos (well, at least ones I <i>thought</i> were cool) that may or not be
        worthy to be shared on the World Wide Web - and though I promise I'm no artist by <i>any</i> means, a piece here
        and there might make the cut.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Software:</b> I hope to upload or link any software I think is useful or cool, paired with system requirements
        or recommendations. My experiences and review of the software might be shared, along with installation instructions
        if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Links:</b> Similar to the software page, I will give other pages the limelight here if I believe they contain
        some sort of useful tool or high-level entertainment value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Contact:</b> My other professional socials, emails, etc. If you spot any issues with the site, please contact me.
      </li>
    </ul>
