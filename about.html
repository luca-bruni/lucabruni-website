    Welcome to my page! A little bit about me...
    <p></p>
    I was born in Y2K and raised in the suburb of Pickering, Ontario. I was lucky to be exposed early to
    a variety of electronics, which I became immediately interested in. The two main faces
    were personal computers (discovered for the first time in my dad's home office) and video gaming
    consoles (enjoyed by the whole family). Just before high school, when I actually began
    to think about my future, I knew I would likely follow my affinity toward the tech industry.
    <p></p>
    In high school, when I got my first iPhone, I wondered whether I could get my hands dirty with app
    development. To gain some understanding, I enrolled in computer science courses throughout my time at
    <a href="https://stmary.dcdsb.ca/en/index.aspx" target="_blank">St. Mary CSS</a>. These classes offered
    great experiences that confirmed my decision to enter the industry. The childhood curiousities about how
    computers work, or how turning on the PlayStation could fill the TV screen with a new interactive world - were 
    beginning to be fulfilled. I joined the Robotics Team for junior and senior year and enjoyed that as well.
    <p></p>
    I decided on pursuing higher education around the general discipline, and selected the 
    <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Science (Co-op)</a> 
    program at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> 
    after learning about its reputation. The difficulty was quite a jump, but this
    allowed me to understand the relationship between software and hardware at a much faster pace. The breadth of
    the CS and math courses made it easy to explore specific topics I was interested in. It was very
    cool, within a study term's window, to have the opportunity to answer questions you've been internalizing for years.
    <p></p>
    I commend the Co-op programs at UWaterloo. They allowed me to gain hands-on experiences while
    their shorter durations gave room for career experimentation. I held positions working with full stack development,
    distributed systems, database administration and development, and IT operations. The alternating system of study/work 
    terms throughout my undergrad kept everything fresh.
    <p></p>
    At the unique campus of UWaterloo I was surrounded by a duality of technological innovation and nature.
    I couldn't have asked for a more fitting and balanced environment to complete my studies. In a way it was a shame to
    graduate in 2023 and leave the campus for the last time because of this, and I do hope to return (at least for part-time studies)
    in the future.
    <p></p>
    Nowadays, I'm a ML SDK Software Engineer II for <a href="https://www.amd.com/en.html" target="_blank">AMD</a> 
    in the Artificial Intelligence Group (AIG), working on the
    <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/rocm.html" target="_blank">ROCm</a> 
    software stack which competes with Nvidia's proprietary CUDA software. This is a position I've held since December 2024. 
    Previously I was a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/" target="_blank">Huawei</a> 
    at the Toronto R&D Centre, working on the performance and optimization 
    team for <a href="https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/product/gaussdb.html" target="_blank">GaussDB</a>, 
    their Distributed Relational Database. I continue to pursue development on passion projects and broaden
    my learning outside of work, some records of which can be found on the other pages.
